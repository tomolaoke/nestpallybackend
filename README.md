Objective: Building a platform for long-term shared apartment and AI engineered Housematemate matching.

Target Market: Students, young professionals, and working adults.

Pain Point: High rent costs and difficulty finding affordable shared living spaces.

Unique Value Proposition: Easy-to-use platform that allows users to find shared apartments, compatible Housemates for long-term stay, at least one year, and hostels for students. 


**Backend and Frontend Development

Start building the backend (using a RESTful architecture). Use Node.js/Express for backend APIs, MongoDB/Postgres for storing user and listing data.

Set up the frontend with React.js, HTML, and CSS.

**Implement user registration, login, profile creation, and listing functionalities. The backend should support CRUD operations for listings and user data.

Integrate the chat feature using WebSockets or a service like Firebase.

**Working backend APIs.

Frontend interface that allows users to sign up, create profiles, and list apartments.


**AI/ML Implementation for Roommate Matching

Implement an AI-based recommendation system using Python/Scikit-learn.

Create a simple algorithm that matches users based on preferences (budget, interests, location).

Optional: Use collaborative filtering or a content-based filtering system for recommendations.


**Basic matching algorithm integrated into the backend.

Ensure the match results appear seamlessly in the frontend.
